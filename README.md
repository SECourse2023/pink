## Development Guide

Please use DevContainers to set up the development environment. To make the gateway work,
you need to create `.devcontainer/gateway.env` which contains the following environment variables:

```env
DOLINK_PRIVATE_KEY=<redacted>
DOLINK_PUBLIC_KEY=<redacted>
```

Ask the project owner for the keys.
